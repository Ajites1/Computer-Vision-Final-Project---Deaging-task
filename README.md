# Computer-Vision-Final-Project---Deaging-task
Final project for Computer Vision

### Instructions to Run Code
To train the model run the `diffusion.ipynb` notebook in the training scripts module. The trainer will save the models to a specified folder `epochs_attempt1` folder. Currently the trainer is training the first iteration of the model. The 3 model architectures that we tested are in the .py files `diffusion_1, diffusion_2, diffusion_3`


You can dowload the weights from the attached google drive. There are testing scripts named `diffusion_test_model#` where # is the model number. These take in a image, current age, and target age and output a new person's image.
